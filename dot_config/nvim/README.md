# Neovim configuration

This nvim dotfiles collection was originally a clone of `bashbunni`'s [here](https://github.com/bashbunni/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim). I have made a lot of changes and customisations to various plugins, the status line, the keymaps etc.,

- you can find my plugins in ~/.config/nvim/after/plugins
- you can find my customizations in ~/.config/nvim/lua/me
